# F1 Prediction

The main goal of this project is to predict the 2024 Formula 1 (F1) Drivers' Championship standings using a linear regression model based on the results of the Grand Prix from 2018 to 2023.

## Project Overview

This research revisits the emergence and history of F1, tracing the origins of the competition, which today holds events on five continents yearly. The project also clarifies the current points system in Formula 1.

## Methodology

The study uses a qualitative research methodology, incorporating a systematic literature review from investigations in academic work repositories. Concepts related to statistics, predictive analysis, and the application of simple and multiple linear regression techniques are revisited.

## Model and Results

The linear model used in the study showed a coefficient of determination of RÂ² = 0.97, indicating that approximately 97% of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables included in the model.

## Contributions

For academia, this article contributes to the study of predictive analysis in F1 and offers opportunities for future research on big data and machine learning.

## Languages and Tools

- Jupyter Notebook (54.8%)
- R (45.2%)

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the predictive analysis of F1 standings and paves the way for future research in the field of big data and machine learning within the context of sports analytics.
